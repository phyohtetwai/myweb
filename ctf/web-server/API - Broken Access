Challenge : Your friend has set up a platform where you can register and post a private note. 
Everything is based on an API. Before setting up the Front-End, he asked you to check that everything was secure.

Site : http://api-broken-access.challenge01.root-me.org/

Solution : There have 4 API options (signup, login, user, note). I'm tested all these APIs and normally work. 
I found the vulnerability in 'retrieve user information'. API is '/api/user'. I found the response 'userid is 2'.
So, i can guess the admin's id 'that is 1'.

API call :
http://api-broken-access.challenge01.root-me.org/api/user/2 #That is my registered user's api
http://api-broken-access.challenge01.root-me.org/api/user/1 #That is admin's api. FLAG can found on admin's note.
