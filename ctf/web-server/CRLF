Challenge : Inject false data in the journalisation log.
Site : http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch14/

1: If i browse this web page, firstly i found 3 logs :
log:
"admin failed to authenticate.
admin authenticated.
guest failed to authenticate.
log:

2: So i use username: "exp" and click Connect button and found extra 1 log :
log:
exp failed to authenticate.
log:

3. I think the developer is control the $username and response $username + "failed to authenticate.".

4. I intercept the request from Burpsuite and send to Repeater. Then i added CRLF payload "%0d%0a" behind the request method :
Request:
GET /web-serveur/ch14/?username=admin%20authenticated.%0d%0aexp&password=none HTTP/1.1
Request:

5. Now, i found the flag in response. 

Note : 
%20 = space ( )
%0d = carriage return (\r)
%0a = line feed (\n)
